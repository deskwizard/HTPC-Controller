Copy python script to desired folder,

Edit HTPC_Monitor.service to set the script path and username it will be running as.

*** Note: wrote assuming only one user, always logged in. **

Device path is hardcoded for /dev/ttyACM0, you can change that value, but ... everywhere really.


Services (roughly...)

cp *.service /etc/systemd/system

chmod +x HTPC*
systemctl enable HTPC*
systemctl start HTPC_Monitor.service

No need to start OnWake and OnSleep, they get call when these events happen if they are enabled.
